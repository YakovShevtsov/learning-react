# 🧠 React Practice Diary

This repository is a collection of my hands-on practice as i learn React and things related to it.

Im committing everything i build while going through lessons and experiments - from tiny components to small projects. Think of it as my personal logbook, where every commit marks a small step forward

Its not meant to be perfect or polished — just real code, written in the process of learning

Feel free to look around — maybe you will find something useful (or at least relatable)
